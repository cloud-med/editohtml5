# EDITORHTML5
Editorhtml5 is an editor for annotating images in html pages, developed by Link-Up as a part of CloudMED project [http://www.cloudmed.it].
It allows you to add to a picture inside your web page:
- Shape annotations such as circles, rectangles, polygons and freehand drawings;
- Textual notes
- Tags

# INSTALLATION

To install the editor, just download the *.zip* file and unzip it.
In order to annotate your personal image, just replace, in  *page1.html*, the value *src* of the *img* element with the path of the image that you want to annotate.

# HOW TO USE

By opening the file *page1.html* you can begin to use the editor.
You can:
- Add shape annotations by clicking on shape buttons
- Modify or move existing annotations by clicking the *note-mod* button
- Add text notes by double-clicking on the shape you want to associate the text to (only the last one will be showed near the image)
- View all text notes linked to a shape annotation by double-clicking on the shape
- Tag an annotation by using the '#' character and starting to type the tag (tags are loaded from a json file that contains entries of ICD9, you can replace it with another json file containing your tags)
